My first post about stuff I'm working on ;)

[We](http://www.openbossa.org/) are working together with [Qt Software](http://www.qtsoftware.com/) guys in the [Qt Kinetic](http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/Graphics/Kinetic) project, specifically with animated layout transitions.

Last week we made our first demo of what is being developed. It uses the basics we've just finished, now we're working to define the final API.  The following video shows this demo:
