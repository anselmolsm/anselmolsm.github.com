Hey! Another post regarding our work with [Qt]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(toolkit)") [Kinetic](http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/Graphics/Kinetic) here at [openbossa](http://www.openbossa.org/) - [INdT](http://www.indt.org.br/).

A quick introduction:  in the end of February I [posted](http://www.anselmolsm.org/blog/layout-animations-with-qt-kinetic/) [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3HbmrNvQl4) showing the first example of layouts animations.  At that time, the API wasn't complete and there was no integration with states and some stuff were hardcoded.

In March some [Trolls](http://www.qtsoftware.com/) visited Recife to speak at [Bossa Conference 2009](http://www.bossaconference.org/) (you can watch the presentations at [http://openbossa.blip.tv](http://openbossa.blip.tv). It was nice because we could talk about the work we're doing together using whiteboards, what makes a huge difference =) .

After Bossa, we continued the development of the Animated Layouts API, making layout proxies transparent and integrating with the [Qt State Machine Framework](http://doc.trolltech.com/solutions/4/qtstatemachine/statemachine-api.html). It now allows the customization of animations per widget, bringing more flexibility in the creation of rich user interfaces using Qt.

The following video shows the [old example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3HbmrNvQl4) with these improvements:

After that, we created some examples in order to show use cases and also to test what had been developed, but it is the next post's subject! (remember what I said in the beginning? ;) )
