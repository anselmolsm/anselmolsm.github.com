A small post.

In the first season, the focus was S60 devices. After the holidays, the new season is about Maemo. =)

Qt Mobile Demos are in Maemo 5 extras-devel, so now it's easier to check them in a N900 near you. First, you need to [enable the extras-devel repository/catalogue](http://maemo-freak.com/index.php/hacks/1334-how-to-activate-extras-extras-testing-and-extras-devel-catalogues) and the demos should appear if you search for "qtmobile".

The packages are:

<p style="text-align: center;">hyperui -> **qtmobiledemo-hyperui**</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">mybudget -> **qtmobiledemo-mybudget**</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">shoplist -> ** qtmobiledemo-shoplist**</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">weather -> **qtmobiledemo-weather**</p>

Future? <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Well, soon [QAbstractKineticScroller](http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-maemo-4.6/qabstractkineticscroller.html) will replace our kinetic list implementation.</span> (Read the comments).

And yes, we have a list of known issues to solve in our free time...

The code still in the same place, [http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/mobile-demos](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/mobile-demos)

That's all for today.

PS: Thanks to Etrunko, who helped a lot with packaging stuff =)
