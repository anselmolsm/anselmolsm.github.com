[Maemo 5 PR 1.2](http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_5/PR1.2) is out with Qt 4.6.2  installed, so developers now can create applications with Qt 4.6 using either the [official scratchbox based SDK](http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Final_SDK_Installation) or [MADDE](http://wiki.maemo.org/MADDE) (remember, "**MADDE** is currently a **technology preview**.")

BUT... there are people who prefer "[Livin' on the Edge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q95BRB_BPiU)". If you are one of those and already want/need to develop with Qt 4.7 (<em>not released yet!</em>) for Maemo 5, using MADDE to build your applications / packages, here is an update to the procedure first [published by the troll ﻿Harald Fernengel](http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2010/02/08/qt-46-for-maemo-5-applications-on-mac-os-x-take-ii/) (AKA harryF). Although the title says "on MacOS X", the steps also work on Linux.

Step-by-step:

  * Install MADDE. [Download it here](http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/MADDE.php).
  * If you are **not** using a Debian based distro, you need to install the "﻿﻿Tools for Debian Packages" package of your distribution (e.g. "deb" on openSUSE, sys-apps/debianutils on Gentoo).
  * Download the script ﻿[fetch-qt4.7.0-latest.sh](http://anselmolsm.org/public/qt/madde-qt47/fetch-qt4.7.0-latest.sh). This script downloads the libqt4-experimental packages from repository.maemo.org and installs then in your MADDE - Before you run the script, remember to adjust the MADDE_PATH variable according to the path you installed MADDE.
  * Download [qt4-tools-latest.tar.gz](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=fX_jj9QbRhMmliRXU_06OE). It contains the Qt tools compiled for the correspondent version, configured for cross compiling. Extract to /opt/qt4-maemo5.
  * Check if **mad** is in your PATH.

To build an application using your fresh environment, run **/opt/qt4-maemo5/bin/qmake && make .**

If you succeeded in the setup process, this should result in a armel binary ready to run on N900. To generate a deb package, you can use the tools offered by MADDE to build a skeleton of debian package and so on.

To run your application on N900, install libqt4-experimental-* packages. If QtQuick (QML) is part of your plans, qmlviewer  is in the package qt4-experimental-declarative-qmlviewer .
