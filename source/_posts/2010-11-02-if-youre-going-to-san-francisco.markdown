"...You're gonna meet some gentle people there"


This part of the Scott Mackenzie's famous song is definitely true. I'm in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) since last Friday and I'm enjoying the city.

The real reason for this trip is the [Qt Developer Days](http://qt.nokia.com/qtdevdays2010), which started yesterday with the training sections and the demo area, where I could see different kind of applications, products and ideas using [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com) or created to ease the development with Qt.


It's just a short post, in a few minutes there will be the first keynote and I have to go downstairs. :-)


This is my first DevDays, special thanks to the [Qt Developer Network](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/) guys who decided to [bring some of the contributors](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/blog/view/qt_devnet_at_qt_devdays)!
