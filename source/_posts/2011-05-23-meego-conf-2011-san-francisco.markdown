I am in San Francisco [again]((http://www.anselmolsm.org/blog/if-youre-going-to-san-francisco/)! =), this time for the MeeGo Conference 2011.

The event is about to begin with the keynote "The Future of MeeGo Starts Now" presented by the president of Linux Foundation, Jim Zemlin.

This time, I'm going to present a talk too! The talk is today and the topic is "Writing applications for multiple MeeGo devices".

There are other talks by openBossa/INdT guys, [check the schedule](http://sf2011.meego.com/program/session-schedule)!
