We are in Berlin, attending the Qt Contributor's Summit. 265 people are discussing very important (and interesting) topics for Qt 5 and the open governance. You can follow what's happening here using the hash code #qtcs on several social networks. And of course, you can check the [wiki page of the event](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/groups/qt_contributors_summit/wiki).

Personally, I am attending sessions related with QML, Qt-Components, [DevNet](http://developer.qt.nokia.com) and open governance.

And yesterday was Thursday, also known as the "Yellow Day":
