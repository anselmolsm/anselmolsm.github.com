2012 is almost over, but there is time for one more post, just the third this year.

After the Qt Contributors Summit 2012, our team at [INdT](http://www.indt.org/?lang=en) received a new task: continue the development of 'The Incredible Circus'. I had worked a little on <em>Circus</em> before, members of the current team worked on the level editor, so maintaining and creating new features for the Qt (Symbian, N9) version was fine. 

Then we also received a more challenging task: extend and maintain the WP7 version, only after making this version behavior like the Qt version - and the level editor, as a consequence. A bunch of new stuff to learn and, in some cases, get along: C#, XNA, WP7 and **Windows** itself :-P

Part of the result of this work was released in version 1.2, an update for the game already published on [Nokia Store](http://store.ovi.com/content/214283) and [WP Marketplace](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/incredible-circus/ae7684da-8cf8-4173-8c69-00e39aaa06c6). This version added a new set of levels and some bugfixes; there are more things to come, we are looking forward the new releases.

In parallel, we also worked in a consultancy about a project using Qt, at a client's office in SÃ£o Paulo. It was interesting to have contact with other developers working in a different way and inside a different organization.

Then the end of the year was time to study HTML5, Javascript. I must admit I underestimated HTML5 too much, but I still not sharing the faith about HTML5 solving all the the things, however for some use cases it's becoming a good alternative.

And a remarkable event in the end 2012 was the [release of Qt 5.0](http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/12/19/qt-5-0/)! Congratulations to [all who contributed with code](http://qt-project.org/qt-5.0-contributors) and also those who helped in many other ways!

Let's see what 2013 brings. Happy new year =)
